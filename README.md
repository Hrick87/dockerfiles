# Dockerfiles for Roc Toolkit

This repo provides dockerfiles for Travis builds and end-user images for cross-compilation.

Docker images are built using Docker Hub automated builds. The corresponding Docker Hub organization is [rocstreaming](https://hub.docker.com/u/rocstreaming).

Documentation for this process is [available here](https://roc-streaming.org/toolkit/docs/development/continuous_integration.html).
